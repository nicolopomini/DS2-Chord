# Chord
Distributed Systems 2 course -- A.Y 2019-2020

_Second assignment_

This is the implementation of Chord [1] using Repast Simphony. The JAR file with the installer is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmU56TmEhIFOnvEGfkbvue9kjkv_USiX/view?usp=sharing

Using the graphical tool of Repast, is possible to configure the parameters for the execution.

Inside the report there are all the details about the project, including the several issues I have faced with Repast.
